# OpenGL stuff

So I wanted to learn meson and I wanted to learn vulkan, and so I thought to start with OpenGL before
vulkan, which is considered a little harder than OpenGl as I've heard.

### Goals  

- learn meson
- create a good foundation for making stuff in OpenGl
- learn how to improve upon what I make
- set a final goal for the repo to have something to actually show like displaying a `.obj` file

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I'm using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and 
> [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) which is of GL version 4.6 with the core profile and generate loader checked.
